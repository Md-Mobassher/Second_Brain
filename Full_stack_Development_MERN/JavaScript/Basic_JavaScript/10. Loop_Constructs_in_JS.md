# Loop Constructs in JavaScript

Loop constructs in JavaScript allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. There are several types of loops available, each with its own syntax, usage, and characteristics. Let's explore the three main types of loops in JavaScript:

## 1. `for` Loop

The `for` loop is a common loop construct used to iterate over a range of values or elements. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration expression.

### Syntax:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

- **Initialization**: Initializes the loop variable.
- **Condition**: Evaluates whether the loop should continue iterating.
- **Iteration**: Updates the loop variable after each iteration.

### Example:

```javascript
// Iterate from 0 to 4
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

## 2. `while` Loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It evaluates the condition before each iteration.

### Syntax:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

- **Condition**: Evaluates whether the loop should continue iterating.

### Example:

```javascript
// Iterate while i is less than 5
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
```

## 3. `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. It evaluates the condition after each iteration.

### Syntax:

```javascript
do {
  // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

- **Condition**: Evaluates whether the loop should continue iterating.

### Example:

```javascript
// Iterate at least once, then while i is less than 5
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

## Summary

- **`for` Loop**: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
- **`while` Loop**: Executes a block of code while a specified condition is true.
- **`do-while` Loop**: Executes a block of code at least once, then repeats while a specified condition is true.

Loops are fundamental constructs in JavaScript for performing repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures. Understanding the syntax and usage of different types of loops allows you to write efficient and concise code for handling various scenarios in your JavaScript applications.
