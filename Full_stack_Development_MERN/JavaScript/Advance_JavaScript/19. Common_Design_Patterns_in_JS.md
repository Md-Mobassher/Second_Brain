# Common Design Patterns in JavaScript

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a structured approach to organizing and writing code, improving code maintainability, scalability, and readability. In JavaScript, several design patterns are commonly used to address different types of problems. Let's explore three of these patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Observer.

## 1. Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used for objects that should have a single, shared instance throughout the application, such as configuration settings, database connections, or logging utilities.

### Example: Singleton Pattern

```javascript
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  // Other methods and properties can be added here
}

const singletonInstance1 = new Singleton();
const singletonInstance2 = new Singleton();

console.log(singletonInstance1 === singletonInstance2); // Output: true
```

## 2. Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates object creation logic and allows subclasses or configurations to determine the type of objects to be instantiated. It is commonly used for creating objects with complex instantiation logic or for implementing dependency injection.

### Example: Factory Pattern

```javascript
class Product {
  constructor(name, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }
}

class ProductFactory {
  static createProduct(name, price) {
    return new Product(name, price);
  }
}

const product1 = ProductFactory.createProduct("Product 1", 10);
const product2 = ProductFactory.createProduct("Product 2", 20);

console.log(product1);
console.log(product2);
```

## 3. Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes to one object (the subject) trigger updates to all dependent objects (the observers). It is commonly used for implementing event handling, pub/sub systems, and data binding in user interfaces.

### Example: Observer Pattern

```javascript
class Subject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  addObserver(observer) {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  notifyObservers(data) {
    this.observers.forEach((observer) => observer.update(data));
  }
}

class Observer {
  update(data) {
    console.log("Received data:", data);
  }
}

const subject = new Subject();
const observer1 = new Observer();
const observer2 = new Observer();

subject.addObserver(observer1);
subject.addObserver(observer2);

subject.notifyObservers("Data to be sent to observers");
```

## Summary

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes, encapsulating object creation logic.
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing changes to one object to trigger updates to all dependent objects.
