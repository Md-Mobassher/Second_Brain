# Private repo add to New Public repo

If you want to push all commits, branches, and tags from your private repository to your public repository while maintaining the commit history, you can indeed use the `--mirror` option. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clone the Private Repository Locally**: First, clone your private repository to your local machine if you haven't already done so. Use the following command, replacing `<private_repo_url>` with the URL of your private repository:

```
git clone --mirror <private_repo_url>
```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository**: Change your current directory to the directory of the cloned repository
   `cd <repository_name.git>`

3. **Add the Public Repository as a Remote**: You need to add your public repository as a remote. Replace `<public_repo_url>` with the URL of your public repository:

```
git remote add public <public_repo_url>
```

4. **Push Your Changes to Public Repository Using `--mirror`**: Now, you can push your changes from your private repository to your public repository using the `--mirror` option:

```
git push --mirror public
```

# Private repo add to Public repo with previous public repo commit

To achieve this, you'll need to follow a slightly different approach. Instead of using the `--mirror` option, you'll need to perform a few additional steps to ensure that you retain the commit history from both repositories and merge them properly. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clone the Public Repository**: First, clone your public repository to your local machine if you haven't already done so:

```
 git clone <public_repo_url>
```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository**: Change your current directory to the directory of the cloned public repository:

```
cd <public_repository_name>
```

3. **Add the Private Repository as a Remote**: Add your private repository as a remote. Replace `<private_repo_url>` with the URL of your private repository:

```
git remote add private <private_repo_url>
```

4. **Fetch the Private Repository**: Fetch the private repository to get all its commits and branches:

```
git fetch private
```

5. **Merge the Private Repository Changes**: Now, merge the changes from the private repository into your public repository. You may need to resolve any merge conflicts that arise:

```
git merge private/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

6. **Resolve Conflicts (if any)**: If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them using your preferred method and then commit the changes.

- if this error
  `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: index.html Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge. Aborting Merge with strategy ort failed.`

- **Commit Your Local Changes**: If the changes in the `index.html` file are intentional and you want to keep them, you should commit them before merging:

```
git add index.html git commit -m "Committing local changes to index.html
```

- After committing your changes, you can attempt the merge again:

```
git merge private/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Or

3. **Stash Your Local Changes**: If you're not ready to commit your changes yet, you can stash them temporarily, perform the merge, and then reapply the changes:

```
git stash
```

- After stashing your changes, attempt the merge again:

```
git merge private/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

- Once the merge is complete, you can reapply your changes from the stash:

```
git stash pop
```

### Merge your code which is conflict

## After merging

7. Stage the resolved changes using:

```
git add .
```

    This command adds all the changes to the staging area.

8. Commit the changes:

```
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts by keeping changes from private repository"
```

    Make sure to provide a meaningful commit message.

9. Now, push the changes to your public repository. Assuming you're merging into the `main` branch, you would use:

```
git push origin main
```

    Replace `main` with `master` if you're using the `master` branch.

By pushing to the branch you're merging into (`main` or `master`), you'll resolve the error and successfully push the merged changes to your public repository. After pushing the changes, verify that the conflicts are resolved and the repository is in the desired state on GitHub.
