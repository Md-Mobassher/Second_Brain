# Functional Programming in JavaScript

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens and avoids changing state and mutable data. In JavaScript, functional programming is supported natively and is commonly used to write clean, concise, and maintainable code.

## 1. Functions as First-Class Citizens

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and assigned to variables.

### Example: Functions as First-Class Citizens

```javascript
// Function as an argument
function applyOperation(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(applyOperation(add, 2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

## 2. Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They enable you to write more modular and reusable code by abstracting common patterns and behaviors.

### Example: Higher-Order Functions

```javascript
// Map function
function map(array, transform) {
  let result = [];
  for (let element of array) {
    result.push(transform(element));
  }
  return result;
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubled = map(numbers, (x) => x * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## 3. Pure Functions

Pure functions are functions that produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They rely only on their arguments and do not modify external state or variables.

### Example: Pure Function

```javascript
// Pure function
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

let result = square(5); // Output: 25
```

## 4. Immutability

Immutability is a key concept in functional programming that encourages the use of immutable data structures and avoids changing state. It helps prevent unintended side effects and makes code easier to reason about.

### Example: Immutability

```javascript
// Immutable array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = numbers.map((x) => x * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3] (original array is unchanged)
```

## 5. Composition

Composition is the act of combining functions to create new functions. It allows you to build complex behaviors by chaining together smaller, reusable functions.

### Example: Composition

```javascript
// Function composition
function compose(...fns) {
  return function (x) {
    return fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x);
  };
}

function add2(x) {
  return x + 2;
}

function multiply3(x) {
  return x * 3;
}

let add2ThenMultiply3 = compose(multiply3, add2);
console.log(add2ThenMultiply3(5)); // Output: 21 (5 + 2 = 7, 7 * 3 = 21)
```

## Summary

- **Functions as First-Class Citizens**: Functions can be passed as arguments, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that operate on other functions, enabling abstraction and modularity.
- **Pure Functions**: Functions that produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Immutability**: Avoid changing state and mutable data, preferring immutable data structures.
- **Composition**: Combine smaller functions to create more complex behaviors.

# Advanced Functional Programming Concepts in JavaScript

Functional programming in JavaScript goes beyond basic concepts like higher-order functions and closures. Understanding advanced concepts like currying, memoization, and monads can further enhance your ability to write expressive and efficient code.

## 1. Currying

Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for partial application of arguments and creates reusable function compositions.

### Example: Currying

```javascript
// Non-curried function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Curried function
function curryAdd(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

let add5 = curryAdd(5);
console.log(add5(3)); // Output: 8
```

## 2. Memoization

Memoization is a caching technique used to optimize the performance of functions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can improve the efficiency of recursive or computationally intensive functions.

### Example: Memoization

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Memoized version of fibonacci function
let memoizedFibonacci = (function () {
  let cache = {};
  return function (n) {
    if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n];
    }
    if (n <= 1) {
      return n;
    }
    cache[n] = memoizedFibonacci(n - 1) + memoizedFibonacci(n - 2);
    return cache[n];
  };
})();

console.log(memoizedFibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

## 3. Monads

Monads are a design pattern in functional programming that encapsulate computation within a context, allowing for sequential and predictable handling of side effects. They provide a way to compose functions that operate on values within the context and handle errors or asynchronous operations in a consistent manner.

### Example: Monads

```javascript
// Maybe monad
class Maybe {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  static of(value) {
    return new Maybe(value);
  }

  map(fn) {
    return this.value ? Maybe.of(fn(this.value)) : Maybe.of(null);
  }

  join() {
    return this.value;
  }

  chain(fn) {
    return this.map(fn).join();
  }
}

let result = Maybe.of(5)
  .map((x) => x * 2)
  .map((x) => x + 3)
  .chain((x) => (x > 10 ? Maybe.of(x) : Maybe.of(null)));

console.log(result); // Output: Maybe { value: 13 }
```

## Summary

- **Currying**: Transforming functions with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions.
- **Memoization**: Caching technique to optimize expensive function calls by storing and reusing results.
- **Monads**: Design pattern for handling computation within a context, providing a way to compose functions and handle side effects.
