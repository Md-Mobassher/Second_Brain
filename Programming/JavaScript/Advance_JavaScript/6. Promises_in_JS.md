# Promises in JavaScript

A promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. It allows you to handle asynchronous tasks in a more structured and readable manner compared to using callbacks directly.

## Creating a Promise

A promise is created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a callback function as its argument. This callback function receives two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.

- **`resolve`**: Used to indicate that the asynchronous operation has been completed successfully, and to pass the result value.
- **`reject`**: Used to indicate that the asynchronous operation has failed, and to pass an error value.

### Example: Creating a Promise

```javascript
let myPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(function () {
    let success = true;
    if (success) {
      resolve("Operation completed successfully");
    } else {
      reject("Operation failed");
    }
  }, 2000);
});
```

## Consuming a Promise

Once a promise is created, you can use its `then()` method to handle the resolved value, and its `catch()` method to handle any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation.

### Example: Consuming a Promise

```javascript
myPromise
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log("Success:", result);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

## Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained together using the `then()` method. Each `then()` call returns a new promise, allowing you to perform sequential asynchronous operations.

### Example: Chaining Promises

```javascript
function asyncOperation() {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      resolve("First operation completed");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

asyncOperation()
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // Output after 2 seconds: First operation completed
    return "Second operation completed";
  })
  .then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // Output: Second operation completed
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

## Promise.all()

The `Promise.all()` method takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved, or rejects if any of the input promises rejects.

### Example: Promise.all()

```javascript
let promise1 = Promise.resolve("Promise 1 resolved");
let promise2 = Promise.resolve("Promise 2 resolved");

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then(function (results) {
    console.log("All promises resolved:", results); // Output: All promises resolved: ['Promise 1 resolved', 'Promise 2 resolved']
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

## Summary

- **Promise**: Represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- **Creating a Promise**: Use the `Promise` constructor, passing a callback function with `resolve` and `reject` parameters.
- **Consuming a Promise**: Use the `then()` method to handle the resolved value, and the `catch()` method to handle errors.
- **Chaining Promises**: Use the `then()` method to chain multiple asynchronous operations.
- **Promise.all()**: Combines multiple promises into a single promise that resolves when all input promises have resolved.
