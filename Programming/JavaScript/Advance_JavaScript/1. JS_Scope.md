# JavaScript Scope

Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables and functions in different parts of your code. JavaScript has three types of scope:

1. **Global Scope**
2. **Function Scope**
3. **Block Scope**

## 1. Global Scope

Variables declared outside any function have global scope. These variables are accessible from anywhere in the JavaScript code.

```javascript
let globalVariable = "I am global";

function printGlobalVariable() {
  console.log(globalVariable); // Output: I am global
}

printGlobalVariable();
console.log(globalVariable); // Output: I am global
```

## 2. Function Scope

Variables declared within a function are local to that function and have function scope. These variables are not accessible outside the function.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  let functionScopedVariable = "I am local to the function";
  console.log(functionScopedVariable); // Output: I am local to the function
}

myFunction();
console.log(functionScopedVariable); // ReferenceError: functionScopedVariable is not defined
```

### Hoisting

In JavaScript, variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope. However, variable assignments are not hoisted.

```javascript
console.log(hoistedVar); // Output: undefined
var hoistedVar = "This is hoisted";

function hoistingExample() {
  console.log(hoistedVar); // Output: undefined
  var hoistedVar = "This is also hoisted";
}
hoistingExample();
```

## 3. Block Scope

Block scope is created with block statements like `if`, `for`, and `while`. Variables declared with `let` and `const` within a block have block scope and are not accessible outside the block.

```javascript
{
  let blockScopedVariable = "I am block scoped";
  console.log(blockScopedVariable); // Output: I am block scoped
}
console.log(blockScopedVariable); // ReferenceError: blockScopedVariable is not defined
```

### `var` vs. `let` and `const`

- **`var`**: Function-scoped or globally scoped. Can be redeclared and updated.
- **`let`**: Block-scoped. Can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope.
- **`const`**: Block-scoped. Cannot be updated or redeclared. Must be initialized at the time of declaration.

```javascript
if (true) {
  var varVariable = "I am var";
  let letVariable = "I am let";
  const constVariable = "I am const";
}

console.log(varVariable); // Output: I am var
console.log(letVariable); // ReferenceError: letVariable is not defined
console.log(constVariable); // ReferenceError: constVariable is not defined
```

## Lexical Scope

Lexical scope (static scope) means that the accessibility of variables is determined by the position of functions and blocks in the code at the time of writing, not at the time of execution. Inner functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = "I am outside";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Output: I am outside
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

## Closure

A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

let counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Output: 2
console.log(counter()); // Output: 3
```

## Summary

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function. Accessible everywhere.
- **Function Scope**: Variables declared within a function. Accessible only within that function.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` within a block. Accessible only within that block.
- **Hoisting**: Variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.
- **Lexical Scope**: Variables are accessible based on their position in the code at the time of writing.
- **Closure**: Functions that retain access to their lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.
