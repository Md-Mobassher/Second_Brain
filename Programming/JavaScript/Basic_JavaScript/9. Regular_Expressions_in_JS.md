# Regular Expressions in JavaScript

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They provide a powerful and flexible way to search, extract, and manipulate text data. In JavaScript, regular expressions are represented by objects of the `RegExp` class or using literal notation with forward slashes (`/regex/`). Let's explore some common use cases and syntax:

## 1. Creating Regular Expressions

You can create regular expressions using the `RegExp` constructor or using literal notation with forward slashes.

### Example: Creating Regular Expressions

```javascript
// Using RegExp constructor
let regex1 = new RegExp("pattern");

// Using literal notation
let regex2 = /pattern/;
```

## 2. Basic Patterns

Regular expressions consist of basic patterns and metacharacters that define the search criteria.

### Example: Basic Patterns

- **Literal Characters**: Match exact characters in the string.

  - `/hello/` matches the string "hello".

- **Character Classes**: Match any character from a set of characters.

  - `/[abc]/` matches any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

- **Quantifiers**: Specify the number of occurrences of a character or pattern.
  - `/a+/` matches one or more occurrences of the character 'a'.

## 3. Metacharacters

Metacharacters are special characters with a predefined meaning in regular expressions.

### Example: Metacharacters

- **`.`**: Matches any single character except newline.
- **`\d`**: Matches any digit character (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
- **`\w`**: Matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
- **`\s`**: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).

## 4. Flags

Regular expressions can have optional flags that control how the pattern matching is performed.

### Example: Flags

- **`g` (global)**: Matches all occurrences of the pattern.
- **`i` (ignore case)**: Ignores case when matching characters.
- **`m` (multiline)**: Matches the start and end of lines within the string.

## 5. Methods for Matching

JavaScript provides several methods for matching strings against regular expressions.

### Example: Methods for Matching

- **`test()`**: Tests if a string matches the pattern and returns a boolean.
- **`exec()`**: Executes a search for a match in a string and returns an array of information.

```javascript
let regex = /pattern/;
let str = "search pattern";

console.log(regex.test(str)); // Output: true
console.log(regex.exec(str)); // Output: ['pattern', index: 7, input: 'search pattern', groups: undefined]
```

## Summary

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and string manipulation in JavaScript. By using regular expressions, you can define complex search patterns and efficiently search, extract, and manipulate text data in your applications. Understanding the syntax and common patterns of regular expressions is essential for mastering text processing in JavaScript.
